# README.md

This is a MicroPython library for the PCA9685 board, for use with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

This code is mostly based on the code from Adafruit before it was depreciated to Circuit Python.

Grab the two files: 
  - servo.py
  - pca9685.py
and save them onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. You can save them using VSCode, or Thonny on Mac, Raspberry Pi and Windows.
